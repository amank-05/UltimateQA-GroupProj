# TEST PLAN - UltimateQA-GroupProj


Goal & Objective
  The goal of our team is to ensure all the web elements are functioning correctly and can be interacted with. In this project, we have taken the BDD
  (Behavior Driven Development) approach, which helps us focus on how the website reacts when a user is interacting with its elements. Moreover, we
  executed our tests using the Cucumber framework to automate our test cases. Additionally, we plan on using Allure reports to view detailed execution of
  our test cases and to verify all test cases are being run smoothly.


Project Description
	This project  is to determine the performance and stability of the overall system. The Agile methodology helps deliver top quality features to our
  clients with better functionality and develop new functionality while maintaining stability with new product increment.  Hence, our team will be focusing
  on regression testing to ensure additional features have not broken or interrupted proper functionality of existing features; and, integration testing
  was also performed to verify if links on the webpage redirect the user to a new webpage. Furthermore, we have added smoke and sanity tests which test the
  functionality of our system end-to-end and functionality of various  features, respectively.  We will also be conducting  hot fixes and fixing bugs
  whenever necessary to ensure our system performs as expected.


Roles and responsibilities
	Each team member took the responsibility of verifying various web elements under the Automation Exercises tab. We focused on integrating the chai
  assertion library to verify if the elements can be clickable, selectable, enabled and exist etc. We also focused on entering values in text boxes and
  verifying correct error messages were returned in suitable environments. 
  
  
Tests and results
  Our test cases include but are not limited to verifying the “Thanks for contacting us” message when name and email are entered, verifying contents can be
  expanded and closed using the show and hide button, verifying “You entered the wrong number in captcha” message is displayed when the math equation is
  answered correctly. Additionally, we verify if links present on the webpage redirect the user to the correct webpages. And, if radio buttons, checkboxes
  and dropdown buttons are functioning correctly by verifying if they are enabled and selected. All our tests must function and run as expected.
